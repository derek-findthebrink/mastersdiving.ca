    "This is the only group of its kind in the City of Vancouver and has been\n",

    "participants. Vancouver is a city that prides itself on supporting physical\n",

    "programs and organisations like the iDive Club that align with these values. The\n",
    "loss of these programs would not only undermine these principles but also remove\n",

    "Canceling these programs would be a loss to the city's sports and fitness\n",

    "\n",
    "<core_messaging>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Importance of the iDive Program\n",
    "\n",
    "- The iDive community is a unique and welcoming group of divers training for fun, fitness, community, and competition.\n",
    "- It is the only diving group of its kind in Vancouver, thriving since 2011.\n",
    "- The program provides essential social and fitness outlets, promoting physical exercise and mental well-being.\n",
    "- It supports community values of physical fitness, mental health, and social engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Impact of Proposed Changes</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "- The City of Vancouver’s proposed scheduling changes threaten the existence of the iDive Masters and Learn to Dive Programs.\n",
    "- New schedule limits training times, making it nearly impossible for Masters and Learn to Dive Members to continue practicing effectively.\n",
    "- Reduced hours and limited facilities (one 1m and one 3m board, no platforms or bubble machines) would significantly decrease program quality and capacity.\n",
    "- The loss of the Masters program, crucial for the club's revenue and coach salaries, will lose ~18 salary hours per week.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Community and Economic Contributions</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "- The iDive Masters program includes ~15 of the 58 registered masters divers in the province (~25%).\n",
    "- Members of the Learn to Dive and Masters programs have participated in local, national and international competitions, bringing recognition to Vancouver’s athletic spirit.\n",
    "- The club’s success in producing high-performance athletes and generating revenue would be compromised.\n",
    "- Adult programs are crucial for inclusivity and promote lifelong fitness.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Arguments Against Proposed Changes</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Only one public pool in Vancouver (Hillcrest) is adequate for diving; Hillcrest is too shallow for safe diving from 3m springboard or 5m platform.\n",
    "- Management is reallocating the dive tank, a purpose-built facility and  limited resource, away from diving to other activities that can be accommodated elsewhere.\n",
    "- Prioritizing children’s programs over adult programs limits opportunities for adult divers and reduces overall program revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Advocacy and Call to Action</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Urge the City of Vancouver to reconsider the proposed scheduling changes.\n",
    "- Highlight the long-standing history and success of the adult diving programs at VAC.\n",
    "- Emphasize the importance of maintaining current training slots (6-8pm) for inclusivity and program sustainability.\n",
    "- Encourage community members to support the campaign by signing the petition and participating in the email campaign.\n",
