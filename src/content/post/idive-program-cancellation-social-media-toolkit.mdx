It seems that we have more success when a post feels personal. Make it personal
that you're losing your diving program!

[This post](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C9mXSbARjLF/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==) seems
to have some decent traction on it. The description is as follows:

> These are the vibes we're about to lose. This is a moment from the masters training session yesterday. Watch it a couple times. Listen to what's being said. We're conquering our fears and refining our technique. We're supporting each other. We're divers from our early 20's to our mid 40's in this clip. Beginners to experts. It's fantastic, and painful, and scary... And we're learning as a team, together.
