title: iDive Program Cancellation
excerpt: The Vancouver Aquatic Centre management is looking to stop iDive from booking past 7pm on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. This means both the masters diving program and learn to dive program are at risk!

**tl;dr**
- Take a look at the <a href="#resources">resources and email templates</a> below
- Over the next couple of days we'll be able to automatically generate email templates for anybody who wants to support the cause
- <a href="#contacts">Email Derek</a> if you want to help out
- Check back in a couple of days!

## What's going on

Early last week (July 10, 2024), the management at the Vancouver Aquatic Centre (VAC) notified iDive that their **current booking times would be limited on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays**. The end of iDive's booking time would now be 7pm. This impacts two programs, the Learn To Dive program and the Masters Diving program. Both of these programs are crucial for the health of iDive as a club, one as a feeder program for the competitive team and the other to support the large number of masters divers currently diving at iDive.

Late last week (July 12, 2024), the management at VAC offered iDive to extend their hours on Tuesdays and Thursdays to 8.30pm, which would allow for part of the two programs to resume, however only half of the pool would be available (one 1m, one 3m), and the platforms and bubble machines would no longer be available. Given the limited board space, the programs would not be able to run at their current capacity.

This is a huge problem! Even with the new time slots available, the quality of the program will suffer and the number of divers who are able to dive over a term will be significantly reduced. Let's try to convince the management at VAC to give iDive back their original booking time!

## Interesting Statistics

- The iDive masters program is currently home to ~15 of the 44 currently registered masters divers in the province. That's about **35% of all masters divers in the province!**

## Here's the plan

We're going to start with an email campaign. Right now, email templates are being built to target specific people in the decision-making chain. Once those are ready, we'll ask everyone to fire off some emails using the templates to get some attention to our cause!

We are also going to create a petition to present to VAC management. The link for that will be available on this blog post shortly.

### Things you can do now

- Email Derek your phone number to get added to the **CMD: Canadian Masters Diving West Coast** Whatsapp group
- Write an email template!

#### Write an email template

We're looking for help! Right now we need email templates written. If you would like to write an email template, please do the following:

- Pick a contact from the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1W64AXkzesC6Px7m3B3ES4ebchBbMV2syJTHdioyYr_g/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Park Board Staff and City Councillors</a> list
- Let Derek know who you're writing your template for
- Write up the template
- Email it to Derek using the link below

After a quick review, your template will be posted here for anybody in the community to use!

Once we have a few templates that are ready to go, we'll do some coding magic on this end! The code will allow each email template to be quickly customized for each person who's doing the sending, so that all someone has to do is fill out a form, pick a person, and then tweak the complete email it writes for them in any way they see fit. I can get that part done in a day or so, we just need more of these templates to be written!

### Templates

Coming soon!

#### Draft Templates

These ones are still being worked on. Check on them for inspiration if you're writing a template, or come back later when these will be ready for primetime!

Some things to remember if you're writing a template:

- **Learn To Dive**: We are also trying to save part of the learn to dive program. Make sure to include that in your email!
- **Inclusion**: We are looking to include all members of our community in this campaign. When you're writing your template, do your best to make it generic enough for it to be used by the following members of our community. It's ok if your template ends up being too specific though, just let Derek know and he'll make sure it's marked as specific for a certain group.
    - Learn to Dive Divers
    - Parents of LTD Divers
    - Masters Divers
    - Coaches
    - Administrators at BC Diving and Diving Plongeon Canada
