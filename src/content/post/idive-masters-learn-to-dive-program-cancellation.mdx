## tl;dr

- **We're almost there!** VAC has agreed to roll-back the schedule changes. Now we're
  just waiting for confirmation that iDive has taken back the scheduling slots
  and will continue to run the Masters and Learn to Dive programs for the upcoming
  diving season.

## What's going on

On July 10, 2024, the management at the Vancouver Aquatic Centre
(VAC) notified iDive that their **current booking times would be limited on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays**.
The end of iDive's booking time would now be 7pm. This impacts two programs, the
Learn To Dive program and the Masters Diving program. Both of these programs are
crucial for the health of iDive as a club, one as a feeder program for the
competitive team and the other to support the large number of masters divers
currently diving at iDive.

On July 12, 2024, the management at VAC offered iDive to
**extend their hours on Tuesdays and Thursdays to 8.30pm**, which would allow
for part of the two programs to resume, _however only half of the pool would be available_
(one 1m, one 3m), and the _platforms and bubble machines would no longer be available_.
Given the limited board space, the programs would also not be able to run at their
current capacity.

At this time this was a huge problem! Even with the new time slots available, the quality of
the program would have suffered and the number of divers who were able to dive over a
term would have been significantly reduced.

So we launched our email and social media campaign.

On July 19, 2024, we received an email from Steve Kellock, the Recreation Director
at Vancouver Parks and Recreation, informing us that VAC is rolling back it's
scheduling changes and instead advancing a new policy for Pool Allocation. This new policy
will be built over the next 12-24 months, and will be built with input from existing
pool user groups including iDive.

The scheduling rollback should allow iDive to retain its current booking slots
for the upcoming 2024-2025 season and beyond. Once we get confirmation from both
VAC and iDive that the schedule changes have been rolled back and the Masters
and Learn to Dive programs will continue in their current form, then we can call this
campaign a success!

## Interesting Statistics

- The iDive masters program is currently home to ~15 of the 58 currently
  registered masters divers in the province. That's about **25% of all masters
  divers in the province!**
- This is a guess, I'm still waiting on numbers, but the iDive Masters program
  probably has 10-15% of all the masters divers in Canada

## Here's the plan

We're going to start with an email campaign. Right now, email templates are
being built to target specific people in the decision-making chain. Once those
are ready, we'll ask everyone to fire off some emails using the templates to get
some attention to our cause!

We have also created a petition to present to VAC management.
[That petition is available here!](https://chng.it/KJczTzrkzf)

### Strategy

I've written up a strategy document that shows what the plan is and where we are
with each step. The document is available at the following link:

## Write an email template

We're looking for help! Right now we need email templates written. If you would
like to write an email template, please do the following:

- Pick a contact from the
  [Park Board Commissioners, Staff and City Councillors](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1W64AXkzesC6Px7m3B3ES4ebchBbMV2syJTHdioyYr_g/edit?usp=sharing)
- Write up the template
- Email it to Derek using the link below

After a quick review, your template will be posted here for anybody in the
community to use!

Once we have a few templates that are ready to go, we'll do some coding magic on
this end! The code will allow each email template to be quickly customized for
each person who's doing the sending, so that all someone has to do is fill out a
form, pick a person, and then tweak the complete email it writes for them in any
way they see fit. I can get that part done in a day or so, we just need more of
these templates to be written!

Some things to remember if you're writing a template:

- **Learn To Dive**: We are also trying to save part of the learn to dive
  program. Make sure to include that in your email!
- **Inclusion**: We are looking to include all members of our community in this
  campaign. When you're writing your template, do your best to make it generic
  enough for it to be used by the following members of our community. It's ok if
  your template ends up being too specific though, just let Derek know and he'll
  make sure it's marked as specific for a certain group.
  - Learn to Dive Divers
  - Parents of LTD Divers
  - Masters Divers
  - Coaches
  - Administrators at BC Diving and Diving Plongeon Canada

## Summary

Alright we're almost there! Hopefully later this week (July 23, 2024), we will
have confirmation that the programs are both good to go for the upcoming 2024-2025
diving season.

Please feel free to check back here for more updates. If we need to go back into
campaign mode for any reason, there will be an update here and there will be messages
in the CMD whatsapp group.

Thanks for reading!
