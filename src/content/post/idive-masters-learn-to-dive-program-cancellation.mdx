## What's going on

Under construction!

## Here's the plan

Under construction!

We're going to start with an email campaign. Right now, email templates are being built to target specific people in the decision-making chain. Once those are ready, we'll ask everyone to fire off some emails using the templates to get some attention to our cause!

### Contacts

- [Park Board Staff and City Councillors](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1W64AXkzesC6Px7m3B3ES4ebchBbMV2syJTHdioyYr_g/edit?usp=sharing)

### Templates

Coming soon!

#### Draft Templates

These ones are still being worked on. Check on them for inspiration if you're writing a template, or come back later when these will be ready for primetime!

Some things to remember if you're writing a template:

- **Learn To Dive**: We are also trying to save part of the learn to dive program. Make sure to include that in your email!

**Drafts**:
