title: iDive Program Cancellation
excerpt: The Vancouver Aquatic Centre management is looking to stop iDive from booking past 7pm on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. This means both the masters diving program and learn to dive program are at risk!

## What's going on

Early last week (July 10, 2024), the management at the Vancouver Aquatic Centre
(VAC) notified iDive that their **current booking times would be limited on
Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays**. The end of iDive's booking time would now be
7pm. This impacts two programs, the Learn To Dive program and the Masters Diving
program. Both of these programs are crucial for the health of iDive as a club,
one as a feeder program for the competitive team and the other to support the
large number of masters divers currently diving at iDive.

Late last week (July 12, 2024), the management at VAC offered iDive to **extend
their hours on Tuesdays and Thursdays to 8.30pm**, which would allow for part of
the two programs to resume, _however only half of the pool would be available_
(one 1m, one 3m), and the _platforms and bubble machines would no longer be
available_. Given the limited board space, the programs would also not be able
to run at their current capacity.

This is a huge problem! Even with the new time slots available, the quality of
the program will suffer and the number of divers who are able to dive over a
term will be significantly reduced. Let's try to convince the management at VAC
to give iDive back their original booking time!

## Interesting Statistics

- The iDive masters program is currently home to ~15 of the 58 currently
  registered masters divers in the province. That's about **25% of all masters
  divers in the province!**
- This is a guess, I'm still waiting on numbers, but the iDive Masters program
  probably has 10-15% of all the masters divers in Canada

## Here's the plan

We're going to start with an email campaign. Right now, email templates are
being built to target specific people in the decision-making chain. Once those
are ready, we'll ask everyone to fire off some emails using the templates to get
some attention to our cause!

We have also created a petition to present to VAC management. <a
href="https://chng.it/KJczTzrkzf" target="_blank">That petition is available
here!</a>

## Write an email template

We're looking for help! Right now we need email templates written. If you would
like to write an email template, please do the following:

- Pick a contact from the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1W64AXkzesC6Px7m3B3ES4ebchBbMV2syJTHdioyYr_g/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Park Board Commissioners, Staff and City Councillors</a> list
- Write up the template
- Email it to Derek using the link below

After a quick review, your template will be posted here for anybody in the
community to use!

Once we have a few templates that are ready to go, we'll do some coding magic on
this end! The code will allow each email template to be quickly customized for
each person who's doing the sending, so that all someone has to do is fill out a
form, pick a person, and then tweak the complete email it writes for them in any
way they see fit. I can get that part done in a day or so, we just need more of
these templates to be written!

Some things to remember if you're writing a template:

- **Learn To Dive**: We are also trying to save part of the learn to dive
  program. Make sure to include that in your email!
- **Inclusion**: We are looking to include all members of our community in this
  campaign. When you're writing your template, do your best to make it generic
  enough for it to be used by the following members of our community. It's ok if
  your template ends up being too specific though, just let Derek know and he'll
  make sure it's marked as specific for a certain group.
  - Learn to Dive Divers
  - Parents of LTD Divers
  - Masters Divers
  - Coaches
  - Administrators at BC Diving and Diving Plongeon Canada

## Summary

Ok thanks for reading this far! We're hoping to have emails flying in the next 3
days. With any luck we'll be successful and the programs can both continue in
their current form.

Please check back here over the coming days to see how you can help out. Thanks
so much for your support!
